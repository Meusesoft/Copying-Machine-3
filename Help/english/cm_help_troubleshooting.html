                    Troubleshooting</h1>
                <h2>
                    My scanner is not detected...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure your scanner is a TWAIN or WIA-compatible scanner and the driver is installed
                    on your computer. Also make sure that you are using the 32-bit version and that
                    the TWAIN_32.DLL is in your Windows or system-directory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Colours from scanned images are not as they should be...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some scanners need to be calibrated before the first scan. Since this isn’t a standard
                    TWAIN-command, Copying Machine perform this operation. In order to get the correct
                    colours use the Acquire-command in the Scanner-menu. This command shows the user
                    interface of your scanner which will be able to do the required calibration. Sometimes
                    you need to make a pre-scan first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Copying Machine gives an error before scanning...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some scanner have problems when an image is scanned without using its user-interface.
                    You can try scanning with the scanner its user-interface by using the ‘acquire’-command
                    in the ‘scanner’-menu. If this works you can enable the user-interface for all scanning
                    operations in the General Settings dialog. Another possibility is that your scanner
                    doesn’t support a particular TWAIN-capability. You can set which capabilities Copying
                    Machine uses in the TWAIN-tab in the ‘Properties’-dialog from the ‘File’-menu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Copying Machine always shows my scanner’s user interface...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hiding a user interface is not a feature supported by all scanners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The first time I try to make a copy I get errors from the scanner...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some scanners have a warm up period. So it could happen the TWAIN-driver times out
                    before your scanner is ready to begin scanning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    I want to save my image as a PCX-image, but I can’t select it in the save-dialog...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Copying Machine supports four different graphic-types; PCX, JPG, TIFF, PNG and BMP.
                    All of these three types have different characteristics, which makes them more appropriate
                    for different kind of images. JPEG is at its best with grayscale and full colour
                    images, PCX with black and white images, and BMP can be used for all types of images.
                    The disadvantage of BMP is that images aren’t encoded and that resolution information
                    is lost. Finally TIFF, can be used with document with multiple pages (images).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Scanning a black and white page results in an inverted image...
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are scanners which have problems scanning black and white images and return
                    an inverted image. The white parts of the scanned page are black and the black parts
                    are white. This cannot be compensated by Copying Machine but you can enable the
                    option ‘Scan inverted’, see File | Settings | General Settings | Scan inverted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    My printer does not print the entire image...

                <p>
                    Check whether you haven’t accidentally made a selection.
                </p>
